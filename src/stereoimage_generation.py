    An effort is made to make them look nice, but beware that the resulting image will have some distortion.
    The correctness was not rigorously tested.

    :param original_image: original image from which the 3D image (stereoimage) will be created
    :param depthmap: depthmap corresponding to the original image. White = near, black = far.
    :param float divergence: the measure of 3D effect, in percentages.
      A good value will likely be somewhere in the [0.05; 10.0) interval.
    :param float separation: measure by how much to move two halves of the stereoimage apart from each-other.
      Measured in percentages. Negative values move two parts closer together.
      Affects which parts of the image will be visible in left and/or right half.
    :param list modes: how the result will look like. By default only 'left-right' is generated
      - a picture for the left eye will be on the left and the picture from the right eye - on the right.
      Some of the supported modes are: 'left-right', 'right-left', 'top-bottom', 'bottom-top', 'red-cyan-anaglyph'.
    :param float stereo_balance: has to do with how the divergence will be split among the two parts of the image,
      must be in the [-1.0; 1.0] interval.
    :param float stereo_offset_exponent: Higher values move objects residing
      between close and far plane more to the far plane
    :param str fill_technique: applying divergence inevitably creates some gaps in the image.
      This parameter specifies the technique that will be used to fill in the blanks in the two resulting images.
